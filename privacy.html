	<h2 style="font-family: Roboto">Overview</h2><p style="font-family: Roboto">Visitors using STREAM services in the United Kingdom play an important role when it comes to big products-to-service movement. In all that shift to services, Privacy needs to be intact, and we will stay committed to this policy.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Roboto">Legend</h2>
<p style="font-family: Roboto">By "we", references are made to STREAM Group LLC., and STREAM Inc. of China.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Roboto">By "you" we mean the consumer using our services appropriately.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Roboto">Third-Parties</h2>
		<p style="font-family: Roboto">
We do not engage in activity involving the purchase or trade of information of our consumers, nor will we ever do so. Third Party trade consists of open-source software, hardware and electronics that have been built from scratch.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Roboto">Accounts & Data</h2>
		<p style="font-family: Roboto">
If you have placed a STREAM Account on any of our services, including Instant, U, STREAM Email or the STREAM Shadow Profile Service, you are able to remove all data related to your account and its existance on our platform. You are never required to make an account to browse content unless payments are involved. Our services, by default will never ask you to create an account or hand over personal information and will always be done voluntarily or by discovery.

Your account is stored under our 4 layer encryption service, which was created by STREAM Inc. of China for STREAM Group LLC. and is handled on Google servers and their storage buckets. Encryption hashes are open-sourced however keys to crack the encryption are held by the users and their passwords. If the consumer forgets their encryption key, all data on their account needs to erased due to the inability to access it.

Your data is handled by Artificial Intelligence systems and software manufactered by STREAM Group LLC. called Adrenaline AI. Your data will never reach the hands of another human being excluding you.

Your data is sent outside of the United Kingdom to other countries in which STREAM operates in. This could be triggered if you travel a lot, have inconsistant IP addresses or use a proxy service. Your data travels to the country your IP address is assigned to and is automatically accessed from the copy at your roaming country. All data written will be written with the time in your roaming country and sent back to the United Kingdom immediately to be processed and added to your account.</p>
<h2 style="font-family: Roboto">Search Engine</h2>
		<p style="font-family: Roboto">
Our search index is extremely big, and we needs loads of servers to handle it all. Your searches are forwarded to our data camps and storage buckets, where they will be sent back to servers handling your specific request. There are obvious flaws in the reliability of this system, such as encryption keys being misread, however it is constantly improving and has a low chance of failure.

Your searches are sorted in form factors of: language, region, time, popularity and relevance, but the scope can be adjusted to beam on one specific area.</p>
